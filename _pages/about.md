ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I am Suriya, a final-year Ph.D. candidate at TU Delft in the Netherlands. ðŸ”¬ I am interested in instabilites, self-assembly and pattern formation driven by physicochemical hydrodynamics. I try to work on projects that have an impact on climate change. I am also passionate about <a href="https://suriyaflow.github.io/suriyaprakash.github.io/opensource/">open science & hardware.</a>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> ðŸŽ“ðŸŽ“ðŸŽ“ In my Ph.D. thesis I study evaporation of particle-laden drops and the buckling of such drops. I am supervised by <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/l.botto/?cHash=7ba1f9f844091f98d5670993cb9cc996">Dr. Lorenzo Botto</a>  in the <a href = "https://www.tudelft.nl/me/over/afdelingen/process-energy/research/complex-fluid-processing">Complex Fluids Processing Group</a> at TU Delft. 

  ðŸŽ“ðŸŽ“ I did my master's in Energy, flow and process technology also from TU Delft. During my master's thesis I built an experimental setup that resembles the prilling process, which is used to make fertilizers. I worked under the supervision of Dr. Wim Paul Breugem and Dr. Burak Eral. I was able to control the process parameters in spinning jet breakup to reduce the production of satellite drops (dust particles) in prilling.

  <p style="text-align: justify;">ðŸŽ“ðŸŽ“ I did my master in Energy, flow and process technology also from TU Delft. For my thesis I built an experimental setup that resembles the prilling process which is used to make fertilizers under the supervision of Dr. Wim Paul Breugem and Dr. Burak Eral. I was able to control the process parameters in spinning jet breakup to reduce the production of satellite drops (dust particles) in prilling. It is estimated that each prilling tower emits 1500 tons of nitrogen based pollutants in to the air every year. I was able to successfully eliminate the satellite drops in the model prilling machine I built.
