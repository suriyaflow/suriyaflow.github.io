# 3D printed syringes feeder 

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="./images/screw_feeder.jpeg" alt="Alt Text" width="300" align="right" style="margin-right: 30px;">
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
      The screw feeder is inspired from the design of <a href = "https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3723903">akimakes</a> but enables dispension and collection (suction) of very small volumes of liquid. My feeder is designed for 1 ml BD plastic syringe. The plunging action is done by a M4 bolt held in place by a M4 nut and the small pitch allows for dispensing or collecting very small amount of fluid. A large 3D printed handle connected to the M4 bolt via a locknut enables precise manipulation. This can be a cheap replacement for <a href = "https://www.hamiltoncompany.com/laboratory-products/syringes/81341">precision threaded plungers</a> with an added advantage of replacing the syringe with a new one when using different liquids.
